The solution involves ensuring unit consistency within each `calc()` expression. Each value should have a unit (such as px, %, em, etc.), and the units must be compatible. Correct operator precedence is also crucial; use parentheses to group operations and clarify the order of calculation.  If calculations involve multiple units, make sure they are compatible. For example, you can subtract pixels from percentages, but you can't directly add percentages to em units without conversion. Always carefully check for these issues. In more complex calculations, consider breaking them down into smaller, more manageable parts for improved readability and maintainability.
