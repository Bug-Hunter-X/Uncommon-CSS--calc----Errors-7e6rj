The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations within CSS. However, it's easy to make errors if the units aren't consistent or if the order of operations is not carefully followed. For example, using `calc(100% - 10px)` is correct, but `calc(100% - 10)` will likely result in unexpected behavior as the units are mixed.  Another common mistake involves nesting `calc()` functions without proper parentheses, leading to incorrect calculations.  Spaces around operators are generally recommended for readability and to avoid parsing issues.
